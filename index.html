    <h2>
      The history that led to old coffee snobbery
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before talking about the first and oldest flavor of coffee snobbery, I need to dive a bit into the history of coffee in America.
      In the early 1900s and even late 1800s there was a gourmet coffee movement with similar goals to modern coffee movements.
      This included treating coffee like a fruit instead of a commodity.
      Things changed greatly with the great depression and the focus soon quickly shifted to getting the caffeine drug into people's bodies as cheaply as possible.
      This started a lot of horrible practices such as reusing coffee grinds, that more likely than not had mold, using incredibly old coffee, and roasting to near charcoal levels.
      This started the old coffee snobs the people who would later grow up and say coffee is supposed to taste bad and be enjoyed with a cigarette.
